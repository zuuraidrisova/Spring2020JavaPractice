        Java Reveiw: Primitives
         Concatenation
         Arithmetic operators
         Comparision operators
        package: Day04_JavaRecap
        primitives: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
        numbers: byte, short, int, long, float, double
        whole numbers: byte, short, int, long
        int is prefered
        decimal numbers: float, double
        double is
        prefered
        Character: char, ''
        every char has a number
        boolean: true, false
        Comparision Operators: both data MUST be matching when we apply those
        operators
        > : greater
        >= : greater or equal
        < : less
        <= : less or equal
        == : equal
        != : not equal
        ! : opposite
        ! true ==> false
        ! false ==> true
        == vs = :
        = : assigning values to variables
        == : comparing the equality
        Arithmetic Operators:
        + : addition
        - : subtraction
        * : multiplication
        / : division
        % : remainder
        remainder: numerator - (denominator * result
        of whole number)
        10 / 4 = 2.5;
        remainder: 10 - (4 * 2) = 2
        remainder of 10 /4 is 2
        15 / 3 = 5
        remainder: 15 - (3 * 5) = 0
        reaminder of 15/3
        is 0
        10 % 4 ==> 2
        remainder of 10 /4 is 2
        15 % 3 ==> 0
        reaminder of 15/3 is 0
        odd number: not evenly divisible by 2 ==> remainder is not 0
        even number: evenly divisible by 2 ==> remainder is 0
             */
