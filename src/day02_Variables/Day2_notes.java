            Variables: makes the data reusable
            decleare variables:

            variabale name rules:
                    1. Must be started with letters
        2. MUST be Unique
        3. cannot be Java Reserved words
        4. cannot contain special character
            other $ and _
            primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
        for numbers: byte, short, int, long, float, double
            whole number: byte, short, int, long
            decimal number: float, double
            range:
            double > float > long > int > short >
            byte
            larger one cannot be asisgned to
            smaller one
            smaller one can be assigned to larger
                    one
            int: prefered primitive by the compiler for whole numbers
            everytime if a number is entered, compiler
            takes it as an int
            double: pefrered by the compiler of the decmial numbers
            float:
            float f1 = 0.5f;
            String: char sequences, string of texts
            String name = "Cybertek School";
