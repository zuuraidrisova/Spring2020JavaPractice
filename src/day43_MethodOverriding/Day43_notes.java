Topics: Method Overriding
Overloading vs Overriding
package name: day43_MethodOverriding
warmup Task:
1. create a class called Shape
vairables: area,
perimeter
methods:
calculateArea(), calculatePerimeter()
2. create sub classes of Shape:
Circle
Rectangle
Square
 give the instance variables that are needed
to calculate the Area, perimeter, of those shapes
AFTER TODAY'S TOPIC:
3. override super class' Area(), perimeter() methods to
the sub classesFormulas:
 Area of the circle:    3.14 * radius *
radius
 Area of the rectangle:  width * length
 Area of the square:    side * side
 Perimeter of circle:   3.14 * 2 *
radius
 Perimeter of rectangle: (width +
length) * 2
 Perimeter of Square: 4 * side
access modifier:
public > protected > default > private
method overloading: same method different parameter
return-type can be same or
different
any method can be overloaded
access modifier can be same
or different
method overriding: same method name, same parameter, same return-type
(MUST)
   MUST happen in the sub class
   access modifer MUST be same or
more visible
   ONLY the instance methods can
be overridden
   @Override annotation MUST be
applicable
why we need overriding: to implement different functions to the same
method
reusable
flexible
less memory
easy to memorize
@Override: identifies if the method is overriden method
Car:
start: Insert the key
   twist ignition key to start
Tesla:
start: push button to start
Honda:
start: Insert the key
   twist ignition key to start
Jeep:
start: call mechanic
       oil change
       jump start
BMW:
start: Call some friends
Tell them to push
Remove clutch peddle suddenly
how many method created: 1
 how many functions: 4
come back: 2:10
