        Warmup tasks:
        0. Wash Your Hands
        1. Ask user to enter two words. Print the first word, second word,
        second word, first word
        Input:
        one
        two
        Output:
        onetwotwoone
        DO NOT USE + OPERATOR
        2. Ask user to enter two words. Print first word without its first
        character then print the second word without its first character.
        Input:
        apple
        banana
        Output:
        ppleanana
        3. Write a Java method to display the middle character of a string
        a) If the length of the string is even there will be two middle
        characters.
        b) If the length of the string is odd there will be one middle
        character.
        Input :
        elephant
        Output:
        The middle character in the string: ph
        String methods:
        indexOf(Value): returns the index number of first occured
        character, as int
        lastIndexOf(Value): return the index number of last occured
        character, as int
        isEmpty(): identifies if the string is empty
        true ==> string is empty,
        false ==> String is not empty
        equals(str): checks if two string' visible texts are equal or not
        cares about the case sensitivity
        A == a  ==> false
        equalsIgnoreCase(str):  checks if two string' visible texts are
        equal or not
        does not care case sensitivity
        A == a ==> true
        contains(str): checks if the str is contained in the string.
        returns boolean
        if str is conatined ==> true
        otherwise ==> false
        startsWith(str): checks if the string starts with the given str.
        returns boolean
        if starts with str ==> true
        otherwise ==> false
        endsWith(str): checks if the string ended with the given str.
        returns boolean
        if ended with str ==> true
        otherwise ==> false
        tasks:
        1. Write a program CheckWords:
        Program accepts 3 words and :
        - if they are same length:      print "All words are same length"
        - if some same length and others not:    print "Not Same nor
        Different lengths"
        - if all different length :  print "All different length"
        2. Write a program StartEndWords:
        you have 2 words that must be 5 characters, and check if last letter
        of first word and first letter of second work are same.
        if either one not 5 chars length:    print "need to be exactly 5
        chars length"
        if last letter of 1st word and first letter of 2nd word match:
        print "Fizz"
        if they do not match:  print "Buzz - did not match"
        3. Ask user to enter a word. Print true is the first and last characters
        of the string are same characters, print false otherwise.
        Input:
        abba
        Output:
        true
        4. Ask user to enter a word. Print "really?"  if the word ends with ly,
        print "never mind" otherwise.
        Input:
        Seriously
        Output:really?
