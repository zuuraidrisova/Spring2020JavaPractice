        warmup tasks:
        1.  write a program that can check the equality of the three given
        numberrs
        declare 3 numbers n1, n2, n3
        if n1 and n2 are equal  => n1&n2 are equal
        if n2 and n3 are equal ==> n2&n3 are equal
        if n3 and n1 are qual ==>n3&n1 are equal
        if all equal ==> all equal
        if none of them are euqal ==> none of them
        are equal
        2. write a program that can find the number of days in a month
         (Assume that Feb has 28 days)
         byte month =  3
        28 days: 2
        30 days: 4,6,9,11
        31 days: 1,3,5,7,8,10,12
        Multi branch if statement (else if) : if there are more than two
        possibilities, or options
        if(Condition1){
        statement1;  // gets
        executed if condition1 is true
        } else if(condition2){
        sattement2; // gets executed
        if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
        } else {  // other wise
        statement3;  // gtes
        executed if all condition1 & 2 are failed
        }
        ONLY ONE OF THE BLOCK GETS EXECUTED
        if(condition1){
        A;   // gets executed if
        condition 1 is true
        }else if(condition2){
        B;  // gets executed if
        condition1 is false, & condition 2 is true
        } else if( condition3){
        C;  // gets executed if
        condition1 & 2 false, and condition 3 is true
        }
        .....
        else{   // otherwise
        N; // gets executed if
        condition 1 & 2 &3 ..  are false
        }
        we can have as many "else if" statements
        next week: nested if
           ternary
