        Topics: While loop
        do-While loop
        package name: day17_WhileLoops
        Warmup tasks:
        1. write a program that can ask the user "enter a number" five times
        and return the maximum number
        hint: you will nedd for loop and if statement
        2. write a program that can ask the user "enter a number" five times
        and return the minimum number
        hint: you will nedd for loop and if statement
        3. write a program which prints out the numbers from 1 to 30:
        1. for numbers which are divisible by 3, print "FIN" instead
        of the number.
        2. for numbers which are divisible by 5, print "RA" instead
        of the number
        3. for numbers which are a divisible by both 3 and 5, print
        "FINRA" instead of the number
        Ex:
        1. 2 FIN 4 RA FIND .... FINDRA
        4. write a program that can calculate the two numbers based on the
        user provided operators, the program will ask:
        1. enter first number
        2. enter the second number
        3. enter the math operators
        (assume that only the +, -, *, /, and %
        will be entered)
        then the system will give the result based on the
        operator
        at the end it will ask if the user want's to
        calculate another numbers, if user entered "NO" or "no", the program will
        stop execution, otherwise it repeats all the previous steps
        (you will need a lop that has true
        condition without the iterator)
        loop: repeating actions
        While loop: repeated if statement
        if(Condition){
        statements;
        }
        while(Condition){
        statements;
        }
        ANY FOR LOOP CAN BE CONVERTED TO WHILE LOOP
        BranchingStatements
        System.exit(0): stops the entire program
        break: exits the loop and switch statement
        continue: skips the current iteration of the loop
        practice task:
        1. write a program that can check if a string of text is palindrome
