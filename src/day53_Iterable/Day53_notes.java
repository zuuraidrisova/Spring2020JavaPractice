        Package Name: day53_Iterator_Maps

        warmup tasks:

        1. write a program that remove the duplicates fron an array of
        String

        2. write a program that can remove the duplicates from an arrayList
        of String

        3. what are the differences between List and Set
        List: Accepts duplicates, has index
        Stack: LIFO
        Set: does not accept duplicates, does not
        have index
        Queue: Accepts duplicates,  does not have
        index, FIFO

        4. how to achieve thread safety

        Iterable(I): Root interface
            classes that implements iterable, gains the ability to
             iterate the objects
        we cna apply Iterator(I) to the classes that are
        implementing Iterable

        Iterator(I):
        1. it allows us to get access to each objects
        of the collections type
        2. it allows us to remove the objects from
        collection


        iterator(): iterates any given collection,
                     then returns Iterator (I)
        hasNext(): check if there are enough elements
                    that can be iterated. returns boolean
        next(): if  hasNext() is true, it accesses to
                     the object and retrieves it
        remove(): removes the current element of iteration
