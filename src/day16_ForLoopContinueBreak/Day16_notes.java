        warmup tasks:
        0. wash your hands
        1. write a program that can print all the ODD numbers between 0 ~ 100
        that can be divisible by 3 & 5
        2. write a program that can print all the EVEN numbers between 0 ~
        100 that can be divisible by 3 & 5
        3. write a program that can calculate the sum of all the even numbers
        between 1 ~ 100
        4. write a program that can calculate the sum of all the odd numbers
        between 1 ~ 100
        5. Write a program that will print out all letters in English
        alphabet in ascending order
        6. Write a program that will print out all letters in English
        alphabet in descedning order
        7. write a program that can calculate the sum of all numbers between
        1 to any given number
        ex:
        input: 100
        output: 5050
        input: 50
        output: 1275
        input : 200
        output : 20100

        break statement: used for exiting switch statement and loops
        whenever we need to forcefully stop the iteration of the
        loop, we can use break statement
        continue statement:  MUST be used in the loop
        skips current iteration
        task:
        write a program that can remove duplicated characters from a string
        abcdabcd ==> abcd
        next monday: while & do while loop
        next Tuesday: nested loop
