    /*
    All products that go into the warehouse go through a machine that checks if
    they are intact.
to declare if the products shipment was good or bad it also get a limited number
 of how many products can be broken for it to be considered a good shipment.

badP is a method that gets an int array named products and an int named limit.

products(int[]) - is an int array representing the products it checked, if the
item is intact it will be represented by 1 if its broken its 0. for example:
 [0,1,1,1,0], this array represents 2 broken items and 3 intact.

limit(int) - represents the max amount of broken items for this shipment to be
 considered good (and the method returns true) for example : products [1,1,1,1,0]
  limit:3, there is only 1 broken product and its less then the limit (3) return true.

example use:

badP([1,1,1,1],5)
returns true

badP([1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],2)
returns false

badP([1,1,0,0],2)
returns false

badP([1,1,1,0],6)
returns true

hint:
create a counter, loop the products, increment it for each 0 you find.
finally compare counter to limit and return true or false
