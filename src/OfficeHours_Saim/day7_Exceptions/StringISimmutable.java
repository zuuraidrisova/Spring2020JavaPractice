    Why String is immutable:

        1.if string was not immutable it would be easy for hackers to change
         your password or log in things like that, its also about
         performance and  Synchronization

        2.Since Strings are immutable in Java, the JVM optimizes the amount
        of memory allocated for them by storing only one copy of each
        literal String in the pool so we save memory by that

        3.It's also faster because there is only one object created is crated
        to refer to if  we try to create a duplicate object

        4.Because immutable objects can not be changed, they can be shared
        among multiple threads freely. This eliminates the requirements of
        doing synchronization. In summary, String is designed to be immutable
         for efficiency and security reasons
         so that is another reason: efficiency and security
