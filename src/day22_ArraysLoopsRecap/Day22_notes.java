        Topics: Arrays & loops practice
        package name: day22_Arrays_Loops
        night Warmup tasks:
        Task01:
        1. create an int array called numbers that has length of 100
        2. assign 1~100 to the array' each indexes
        3. use for each loop to print out all the even numbers.
        Must use continue statement
        Task02:
        1. Write a program that will take five Strings and save them into
        an array called arr.
        2. use for each loop to print out the first three letter of each
        element of arr, one per line. You can assume that every
        element of arr is at least 3 letters long.
        Example:
        arr -> ["apple", "banana"]
        prints: app
        ban
        morning warmup tasks:
        1. write a program that can reverse the array
        2. write a program that sort the array in descending order
        3. write a program that can return the number of appearances of
        âjavaâ and âpythonâ anywhere in the sentence
        (itâs similar to the task 97 in repl.it,
        But this time you MUST use arrays and for each loop)
        4. write a program that can count the even and odd number from an
        array of integers
        MUST use for each
        loop
        Arrays.toString(): converts any single dimensional array to string
        Arrays.deepToString(): converts multi-dimensional arrays to string
        tomorrow' office hour:  2pm ~ 5pm
        nested loops and
        arrays
