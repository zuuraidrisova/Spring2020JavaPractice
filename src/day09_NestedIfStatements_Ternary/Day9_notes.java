        package name: day09_NestedIf_Ternary
        class name: ageGroups
        Warmup tasks:
        1. Wash your hands
        2. Join the channe "question_answer", instructor Saim will be
        providing you extra supports in that channel
        3. write a program that can define the age groups of a person
        age groups are:
        infant (< 1 year)
        Toddler (3 - 5),
        Kid (6 - 9),
        Pre-Teen (10 - 12),
        Teenager (13 - 17),
        Young Adult (18 - 20),
        Adult (21 - 39),
        Young Middle-Aged Adult (40 - 49),
        Middle-Aged Adult (50 - 54),
        Very Young Senior Citizen (55 - 64),
        Young Senior Citizen (65 - 74),
        Senior Citizen (75 - 84),
        Old Senior Citizen (85+)
        if age > 120 or less than 0 ==> invalid entry
        if statement without curly braces: the block can only contain a single
        statement without the curly brace
        if(9>8)
        System.out.println("9 is greater than 8");
        THIS IS NOT A GOOD HABIT
        ternary: if statement' short cut
        int num =100;
        String result = "";
        if(num %2 == 0){
        result = "Even";
        }else {
        result = "Odd";
        }
        ? means if keyword, : means the else keyword
        converting to ternary:
        variable  = (condition)? body : body;
        String result2 = (num %2 == 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";
        IN TERNARY TOTAL NUMBER OF ? AND TOTAL NUMBER OF : MUST BE EQUAL
        Nested If: if the condition can be evaluate to multiple scenario
        if multiple scenario execution depends on a specific
        requirment
        if we have precondition
        if(pre-condition){
        statementA
        if(Condition1){
        statementB
        }
        }
        statementA: only if precondition is true
        only statementA: if precondition is true, condition1 is false
        statementB: if precondition is tre, and condition1 is true
        only statementB: impossible
        Tomorrow:
        switch statement
        Scanner
             */
