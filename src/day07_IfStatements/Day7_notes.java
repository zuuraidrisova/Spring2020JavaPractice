        class: ValidTriangle
        class: MaxNumber
        warmup tasks:
        1. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal
        to 180 degrees. Write a program that declares three integers as angles and
        check whether a triangle is valid or not.
        2. write a java program that accepts three numbers and return the
        maximum number
        (assume that none of them are equal)
        3. write a java program that accepts three numbers and return the
        minimum number
        (assume that none of them are equal)
        4. write a java program that accepts three numbers and rteurn the
        mediam number
        (assume that none of them are equal)
        5. write a java program that can identify if a person is eligible to
        vote for Donald Trump
        age of voting: 18
        Note : use single if statements, do not use scanner
        single if statement:
        if(Condition){
        code fragment1;
        }
        execution of the code fragment1 depends on
        the condition
        if & else statement: whenre there only 2 possibilities, not more or not
        less
        if(Condition){
        Statement1;
        } else {
        statement2;
        }
        if block only executed if the condition is true
        else block only gets executed if the condition of if
        block is false
        statement 1: if the condition is true
        statement 2: if the condition is false
        ONLY ONE OF THE BLOCKS GETS EXECUTED
