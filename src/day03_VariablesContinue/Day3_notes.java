        warmup task:
        Create a class called salary calculator, write a program that can
        calculate the taxt, and salary after tax based on the hourly rate & tax
        rates
        ex:
        if:
        rate = 55;
        stateTaxRate = 0.04;
        federalTaxRate =0.22;
        weeklyHours = 40;
        then output will be:
        your salary is: 105600 USD
        your total tax is: 27456 USD
        your income after tax is:
        78144 USD

        concatenation vs addition: +
        number + numer ==> addition
        text + number ==> concatenation
        number + text ==> concatenation
        text + text ==> concatenation
        remaining primtives: char & boolean
        boolean : the expressions that's evaluate to true or flase
        10 > 9 ==> true
        boolean result = 10 > 9 ;
        char: used for single characters, MUST be given within ''
        char ch1 = 'A';
        every single character has its own corresponding number
        comparision operators: returns boolean
        >: greater
        20 > 9 ==>true
        >=: greater or equal
        9 >= 9 ==> true
        <: less
        10 < 20 ==>true
        <=: less or equal
        10 <= 10 ==>true
        == : equal
        8 == 8 ==> true
        != : not equal
        10 != 10 ==> false
        Ascii Table: is auniversal system that's understood by all the computers
        Arithmatic operators: only works with numbers
        + : addition
        - : subtraction
        * : multiplication
        / : division
        a number cannot be devided by 0
        % : remainder
        10 / 4 = 2.5
        remainder: numeator - (denominator *
        result of wholenumber )
        10 - (4 *
        2) = 2
        10 / 3 = 3.333...
        remainder: 10 - (3 * 3) =1
        10 % 4 ==> 2 when 10 is devided by 4,
        there is a remainder 2
        10 % 3 ==> 1
