        /*
      Custom Class --> is class we can create ourselves
                       where objects come from, decides how objects should behave

      String class:  --> text, index called data or attributes of String class
            actions of class ==> methods : length(), trim(), substring(), etc...

            String class is built in Java class


            // we can create our own classes :


            car class:

                data/Attributes:
                            brand, model, year, color, mileage

                 actions/functions :
                                drive(), stop(), etc...

        objects : comes from class...we can create multiple objects from class

                  new --> keyword to create an object

                  ArrayList<> list    =    new ArrayList<>();
                  class    reference name        object

            Car car1 = new Car();


           Instance variables ==> part of objects, object variables
                                  declared outside the blocks or methods,
                                  can be used outside
                                  dont have to initialize
                                  each object has its own copy

           Local variables ==> variables that are declared within a block
                                have to initialize


        Instance methods: object methods
                          does not have static
