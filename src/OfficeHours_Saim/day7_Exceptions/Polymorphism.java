public class Polymorphism {
    /*

    Object obj = new Object();
reference type |    object type

left side is always reference type
right side is always object type

        What different forms can an object take?

            an object can have reference for:
                - itself
                    ex: Object obj = new Object();
                - its super classes

                    ex: String str = new String();==> can be itself
                                or
                        Object str = new String(); ==> can be super class
                                or
                        Interface str = new String();
                        any interfaces that are implemented
