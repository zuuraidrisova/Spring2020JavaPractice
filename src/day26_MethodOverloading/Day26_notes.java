        Topic: Method Overloading
        packaga name: day26_MethodOverloading
        Warmup tasks:
        1. write a return method called frequency that accepts two
        parameters: string str and char ch, the method returns the
        frequency of the ch from the str as an int
        Ex:
        frequency("AAA", 'A') ==>  3
        frequency("ABAB", 'B') ==> 2
        Note: MUST use Arrays and for each loop
        2. use the above method to create another called uniques that accepts
        a string paramter and returns it's unique characters as String
        Ex: uniques("ABBC");      ==> "AC"
        uniques("Cybertek");    ==> "cybrtk"
        method overloading: multiple methods sharing the same name
        Parameter MUST be different
        (either the datatype or number of parameters)
        benifits: easy to read
          reusable
          easy to remember
          very flexible
        only the parameter matters (MUST be different)
        return type does not matter (can be same or different)
