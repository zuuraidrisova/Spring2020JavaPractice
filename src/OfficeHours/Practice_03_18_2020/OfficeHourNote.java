            All the operators
            single if statement
Package name: Practice_03_18_2020
all operators we have learned:
                                +, -, *, /, %
                                +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
                                +, -, --, ++
                                >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=, !, &&, ||
%: numerator - (denominator * Whole Number for result)
    10 / 3 = 3.333333;
    remiander: 10 - (3 * 3)
                10 - 9
                1
post increment/decrement: first passing the current value, and then increase/decrease by 1
                    place the operators after the vairble name
                    int a = 20;
                        a++;
pre incraement/decrement:  increase/decrease value by 1 immediately
                    place the operator before the variable name
                    int a = 20;
                    ++a;
    warmup task:
        write a program that can check the age of a person if he/she is qualified to buy alchohol
        write a code of happiness
