        Topic: Methods continue
        return methods
        package name: day24_Methods
        Warmup tasks:
        1. write a methods that can return the maximum number between two
        numbers
        Ex: Max(10, 20) ==> 20
        2. write a method called Calculation, that passes 3 parameters: 2
        numbers and one operator, and prints out the calculation
        if operator is not between [-, +, *, /, %] output should be
        Invalid Operator
        Ex: calculate(10, 2, '*') ==> 20;
        calculate(10, 2, '&') ==> Invalid operator
        NOTE: The method MUST take three arguments when it's called
        3. write a method that can identify if a string is palindrome
        ex: palindrom("level")  ==> true
        palindrome("Cybertek") ==> false
        task from yesterday:
        4. creata a function that can print the maximum number from any
        given array
        5. creata a function that can print the minimum number from any
        given array
        6. create a function that can print out the array in descending
        order
        [1,2,3] == > [3,2,1]
        declare methods:
        AccessModifier Specifier return-Type
        methodName(Paramter){
        Statements
        }
        Acccessmodifer: public
        specifier: static, final, abstract, synchronized
        return-type: void, any other data type
        paramter: any dataType
        static: can be called through class name
        return methods: return-type is not void
        it's mandatory to return value from the method
