--------------------------------
Question: What the difference between final, finally, finalize?

final - not being able to change a variable, overriding a method, or inheriting a class

finally - a code block that is executed always. This attached to a try block


finalize - a method that is called whenever the garbage collection works --
GC cleans the memory by removing any objects that have no reference
