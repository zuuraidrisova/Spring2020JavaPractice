        CLASS STARTS AT: 10:10 AM
        package name: day15_ForLoop
        class name: initials
        warmup tasks:
        0. THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE JOINED ZOOM, PLEASE HELP OUT THOSE WHO
        COULDN'T
        1. write a program that asks user's first and last name, then prints
        out the initials of the user
        Ex:
        input:
        cybertek
        batch18
        output:
        your initial is: CB
        2. write a program that can reverse the following string:
        String str = "Java";
        output: avaJ
        please provide two solutions:
        first solution, you MUST use substring method
        second solution, you MUST use charAt method
        go to canvas -> java -> modules -> Day15  and complete String short quiz
        MAKE SURE USE CHROME BROWSER,
        loop: repeated action
        for loop:
        for(Initialization; Condition; Iterator){
        statements;
        }
        initialization : starting point (MANDATORY)
        int a = 0;
        condition: created based on the initalization, indicating the
        ending point of loop (MANDATORY)
        a < 5
        Iterator: Co-related with condition, decides when the loop
        should end
        either increases/decreases the value of
        initialization
        MUST BE CAPABLE ENOUGHT TO MAKE THE CONDITION
        FALSE
        if we dont give iterator, we will not get compile
        error, but we will get logical error
        in the lloop, as long as condition is true, it gets executed, only
        stops when condition become false
        order:
        1. initialization
        2. condition
        if condition is true:
        3. statements
        4. Iterator
